The Essential Worker is a zine documenting the experiences of young workers radicalized by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We publish essays, fiction, comics, journalism, poetry, and other media exploring the crisis from a working-class perspective. Our goal is to develop class consciousness among our peers and to further the project of revolutionary socialism.

We seek perspectives of those most affected by Coronavirus, particularly 'essential workers' and people of color, queer, trans, disabled, and indigenous people, immigrants, and members of any other at-risk or oppressed class.

We are anti-racist and anti-imperialist and strive for intersectionality. Our current editors are U.S. based, but we welcome perspectives from around the world.
